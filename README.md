# Calculator


The Android calculator application is a powerful and convenient tool that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with ease. The application is built using the Java programming language and provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to input numbers, select the desired operation, and view the result.

One of the key features of this calculator application is its ability to keep a history of the operations that the user has performed. This feature enables users to review their previous calculations, check their results, and even make corrections if necessary. The history is displayed in a scrollable list, with each entry showing the operation performed, the operands used, and the result obtained.

To implement this functionality, the calculator application uses Java code to manage the user interface and handle the arithmetic calculations. The app uses event handlers and listeners to detect user inputs, and it employs data structures and algorithms to manage the history of operations. Each time the user performs a new calculation, the application adds a new entry to the history list, along with the details of the calculation.

The calculator application provides a streamlined interface that is easy to use, with a keypad for entering numbers and buttons for selecting the desired operation. The app includes advanced features such as a scientific calculator, which offers additional functionality for more complex calculations.

Overall, the Android calculator application is a useful tool for anyone who needs to perform basic arithmetic calculations on the go. It provides a convenient and easy-to-use interface, along with advanced features and a history function that makes it an essential tool for students, professionals, and anyone else who needs to crunch numbers on a daily basis.
